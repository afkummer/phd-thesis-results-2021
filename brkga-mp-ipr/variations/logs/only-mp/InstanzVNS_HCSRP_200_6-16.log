Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 157 with skills = {4,5} and cost = 442.0
   Vehicle #0 = 24, leaving at = 210.4
   Vehicle #1 = 13, leaving at = 210.4
   Increment on distance indicator: 36.5
   Increment on tard indicator:     10.7
   Value of tmax indicator:         36.5
