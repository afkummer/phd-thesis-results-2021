Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 129 with skills = {2,-1} and cost = 1618.9
   Vehicle #0 = 3, leaving at = 568.9
   Vehicle #1 = -1, leaving at = inf
   Increment on distance indicator: 3.2
   Increment on tard indicator:     120.9
   Value of tmax indicator:         3.2
