Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 67 with skills = {2,4} and cost = 837.3
   Vehicle #0 = 2, leaving at = 961.0
   Vehicle #1 = 47, leaving at = 993.0
   Increment on distance indicator: 6.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     2.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         6.0
