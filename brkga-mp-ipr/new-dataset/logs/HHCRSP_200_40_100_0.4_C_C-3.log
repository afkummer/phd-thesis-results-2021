Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 75 with skills = {4,-1} and cost = 398.7
   Vehicle #0 = 28, leaving at = 775.0
   Vehicle #1 = -1, leaving at = inf
   Increment on distance indicator: 10.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     0.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         10.0
