Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 368 with skills = {0,3} and cost = 1021.0
   Vehicle #0 = 15, leaving at = 794.0
   Vehicle #1 = 64, leaving at = 800.0
   Increment on distance indicator: 10.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     2.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         10.0
