Sorted sequence of worst to best tardiness value:
Task for patient = 50 with skills = {2,4} and cost = 440.3
   Vehicle #0 = 5, leaving at = 809.0
   Vehicle #1 = 23, leaving at = 806.0
   Increment on distance indicator: 13.0
   Increment on tard indicator:     0.0
   Value of tmax indicator:         13.0
